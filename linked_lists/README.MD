Structure of a Linked List
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node in the list.

A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list. Below is a basic representation of a linked list:

[ NODE(head) ] -> [ NODE ] -> [ NODE(tail) ] -> nil


Assignment
You will need two classes:

LinkedList class, which will represent the full list.
Node class, containing a #value method and a link to the #next_node, set both as nil by default.
Build the following methods in your linked list class:

#append adds a new node to the end of the list
#prepend adds a new node to the start of the list
#size returns the total number of nodes in the list
#head returns the first node in the list
#tail returns the last node in the list
#at(index) returns the node at the given index
#pop removes the last element from the list
#contains? returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
#find(data) returns the index of the node containing data, or nil if not found.
#to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( data ) -> ( data ) -> ( data ) -> nil
